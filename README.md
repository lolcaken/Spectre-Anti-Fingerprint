# Spectre-Anti-Fingerprint
Spectre: Final Edition
A sophisticated anti-fingerprinting userscript designed to protect your privacy by making your browser look like every other one. Instead of trying to be invisible, Spectre creates a consistent, plausible, and common browser persona, allowing you to blend in seamlessly.

Core Philosophy
Most anti-fingerprinting tools try to "hide" by blocking APIs or returning random data. This is often detectable. Spectre's philosophy is to blend in, not hide. It meticulously crafts a believable profile—a "chameleon"—that is consistent across sessions and domains, making you an unremarkable user in a sea of millions.

Key Features
Deterministic Persona: On the first run, Spectre generates a stable, common browser profile (e.g., Windows 10 + Chrome 115) and sticks to it. This prevents your fingerprint from changing every time you visit a site.
High-Resolution Timer Fuzzing: Defeats timing-based fingerprinting by adding deterministic jitter to performance.now() and reducing its precision, making your hardware's performance characteristics harder to discern.
Advanced WebRTC Filtering: Prevents WebRTC from leaking your local IP address by filtering private ICE candidates and forcing all traffic through a relay (TURN), which helps bypass VPN leaks.
Request Wrapping: Normalizes fetch and XMLHttpRequest calls to enforce a no-store cache policy and prevent unique header leaks, further reducing cross-site tracking vectors.
Comprehensive API Spoofing: Mitigates a wide range of fingerprinting vectors, including Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, Navigator properties, Screen resolution, Fonts, Plugins, and more.
Zero Configuration: Designed to work out-of-the-box. Simply install it and enjoy enhanced privacy without any complex setup.

Installation
Install a userscript manager like Tampermonkey.
Click the raw spectre-final-edition.user.js file.
Tampermonkey should prompt you to install the script. Accept the installation.
Visit a site like Browserleaks or Am I Unique to see the results.

Important Considerations
Potential for Site Breakage: By modifying fundamental browser APIs, Spectre may cause some websites to malfunction or display incorrectly. This is an unfortunate trade-off of advanced privacy protection. If a site is broken, try disabling the script temporarily.
WebRTC Limitations: While Spectre's WebRTC filter is highly effective at preventing private IP leaks, it cannot hide your public IP address. For full anonymity, you should still use a trusted VPN and/or a TURN server.
What It Doesn't Do: Spectre operates within the page context and cannot change server-side HTTP response headers (like Cache-Control) or low-level network properties outside of WebRTC's control.

How It Works (A Simplified Overview)
Persona Creation: When you first install it, the script picks a common browser configuration (a "persona") and saves it. This persona includes your User Agent, screen resolution, timezone, and other key settings.
API Spoofing: The script overrides many browser JavaScript APIs (navigator, screen, canvas, etc.) to return the values from your saved persona instead of your real ones.
Deterministic Noise: For things that are naturally unique (like Canvas fingerprints), it adds very subtle, domain-specific "noise" that is consistent every time you visit that site. This makes the fingerprint look like a common, slightly imperfect hardware/software combination.
Network Protection: It intercepts WebRTC and network requests to filter out sensitive information (like your local IP) and normalize request patterns, making you harder to track across different websites.
